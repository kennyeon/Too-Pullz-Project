    "abstract: _This project aims to predict the gross of a movie through multivariate linear regression to inform stakeholders about profitability, as some highly grossing films result in huge net losses. We also aim to predict, through multivariate logistic regression, whether a movie will be highly rated on the IMDB platform to inform stakeholders of projected audience opinion. The two response variables of interest are predicted based on a dataset containing predictors such as actor facebook likes, country of origin, release year, and production budget. Simple regression and logistic models for gross and IMDB score were created to maximize inference and prediction. A tentative logistic model classifying highly profitable movies was also explored for a more complete analysis through the lens of inference. Our regression model aims to minimize MAE, while the logistic model aims to optimize the precision and FPR metrics. Lasso and forward stepwise selection were used to further optimize variable selection and inference after initial analysis and transformations of categorical and numerical predictors. Greater popularity of actors and slightly higher durations of films seemed to contribute most beneficially to both high gross and high ratings, while budget had a more significant impact in predicting gross_.\n",

    "  Our group was interested in performing an analysis on film data, as we all enjoy watching movies, but know relatively little about the inner workings of the film industry. Upon finding our dataset on Kaggle, we wondered if we could determine what factors contribute to a movie’s success, as it pertains to money and imdb rating. After conducting some preliminary research, we developed a basic understanding of the conditions that qualify a movie as successful. If a movie’s income exceeds its budget, then the movie is technically deemed profitable."

It was easiest for me to just push to the main while coordinating with my group separately about when I was doing so in order to make sure we were not losing work. For a while, my GitHub desktop was giving me issues, and so I had Lila commit my new files for me by sending them over to her. While it was not the easiest of roads, I think I am more comfortable with GitHub as we are ending the quarter. I think I could definitely use GitHub on my own with a branch; the stress of making sure we were coordinating pushes, pulls, and merges accordingly as a group was the most concerning part about using the platform. In my opinion, GitHub did make things easier in the end, but I can see how if the whole group was 100% comfortable using it it would be even more useful."
