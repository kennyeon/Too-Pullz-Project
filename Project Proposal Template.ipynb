    "We will utilize multiple linear regression models to explore our problem through the various predictors present in the dataset, such as director facebook likes, the genre of the movie, the runtime, etc. Linear regression is a relatively inflexible method, so we are not expecting highly accurate results using such models. While movie studios are reluctant to release specific values on profit/income thresholds, generally “3x its production budget is the conventional rule of thumb but it's sometimes more if it has a disproportionately large ad-spend or some of the people involved have profit participation.” With information such as this, and through further research, we will set a threshold/limit value on our error that will maximize the probability that the income predicted is greater than the threshold income that constitutes a successful movie. <br>\n",
    "For the classification objective of our project, we will aim for a minimized false positive rate, so that studios can have a prediction of the high or low projected rating of a prospective film before it is released or invested in, which can have motivating effects on the financial decision making or decision making in regards to changing some of the predictors we are using in our model. For example, if our model finds that longer films are highly correlated to high ratings, maybe the stakeholders will feel inclined to rework the movie length if high ratings are an important objective to them. \n"
